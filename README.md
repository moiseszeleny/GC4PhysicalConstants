# GC4PhysicalConstants

**Genetic Computing for Physical Constants using AI**

This repository contains analytic snippets generated through generic computation for future AI-based analysis. The goal of this data is to identify patterns and relationships between fundamental physical constants. These data surve as the inputs for several AI techniques to be deployed for the analysis of the topological structure that may reflect the underlying connections in high-dimensional functional space.

If you use these data with analytic functions, please cite the following work:

## How to Use the Files in This Repository

All analytic expressions up to rank 70 are organized in a dictionary and stored in a compressed JSON file. Here's an example of how to read such files:

```python
import gzip
import json

jsonfilename = "standard_model_snippets.json.gz"
with gzip.open(jsonfilename, 'r') as fin:
    data = json.loads(fin.read().decode('utf-8'))
```
Here, ```data``` is a dictionary where the keys range from 6 to 70, representing analytic ranks. Each value associated with a key is a list structured as follows:

```
[equation,error,predicted,target]
```
where "equation" is the symbolic equation (using the notation close to LaTeX), "error" is the obtained uncertainty (expressed as a percentage to the target value), "predicted" is the predicted value, and 
"target" is the actual value of the constant.  There are more than 83,000 analytic snippets. All duplicate entries have been removed. 

The data listing does not have precision constraints applied. This means  |predicted - target| difference is always within the measured uncertainty of the target value as defined by the Standard Model. The limitation of  1% relative precision as in the in the original publication was not used.

## Note

We are constantly improving this set of analytic snippets as more CPU power becomes available. Therefore, the number of snippets above the rank 15 may be larger than what was presented in the listings of the original paper. The differences mainly affect the least precise constants of the Standard Model.
